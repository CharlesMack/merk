### **About the Project**

Merk is a foundational project by P.O.P.S. Cinema, created to serve as an elegant and simple starting point for both new and professional users. It foregoes complex, overwhelming features in favor of a straightforward interface that emphasizes the essentials: a quality image, manual control, and an appreciation for classic aesthetics. This version is a direct response to a demand for tools that prioritize the user's skill and artistic eye over an endless list of technical specifications.
